# College-Management-System Project

1) First of all you need to open the whole web application project on Microsoft Visual Studio and there are 3 components Model-View-Control ASP.NET(MVC). You will see the sql server database on the left side with name faiyazEntities localdb which will conclude the all the 5 database tables that are Student, Teacher, Subject, Courses and Admin Login. In shared folder on right side of solution explorer you need to create the AdminLayout.cshtml View page to see the adminlayout of dashboard on server.

2) Then, you need to create the ADO.NET Entity Data Model to update the model from database. so, you will get the 5 database tables with all the entities in the table in Model folder on right side there is a solution explorer.

3) You need to create the Controller of CollegeController.cs file and HomeController.cs file. In college controller you need to create the object of faiyazentities and do the coding part for CRUD method that I have created the methods Index, show, delete, edit, edit. 

4) Then, you need to create the View for Index, show and edit. You can run from the any views of Index, show and edit to see the solution of projects. And from the view page you can run the execution of project running successfully by right click on index view there will be an option view in browser(Google Crome) or any other browser. But, please see the correct URL link while you have run the project on server then, only you will see the solution running perfectly.

5) Final step, if you need to add the data then, run the view page of index, if you need to show the data in the table then you need to run the view page of show and if you need to edit the data then you need to run the edit view page. But note that you will get the edit and delete option on show view page when you run the show view page so, from there you will delete or edit the data successfully.
